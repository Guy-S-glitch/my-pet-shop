# Pet Shop: A Fullstack Project

Welcome to the Pet Shop project! This is my first fullstack endeavor, aiming to create a comprehensive platform for pet enthusiasts. As of now, the project is in its initial phase with a focus on developing a robust frontend using Angular. The goal is to enable users to browse, add, and remove pets from their shopping cart, and ultimately purchase them.

## Features

- **Browse Pets**: Users can view a list of available pets.
- **Manage Cart**: Add or remove pets from the shopping cart.
- **Purchase**: Complete the purchase of selected pets. 
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in functionality.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage pet listings.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: TBD (Planning to C#)
- **Database**: TBD (Considering SQL)
